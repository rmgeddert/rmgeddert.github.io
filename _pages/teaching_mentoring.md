Teaching and mentoring are a particular passion of mine. I would not be where I am today without the tireless support and encouragement of the mentors in my life now and in the past. Passing on my knowledge to undergraduates and other colleagues is just a small way of paying that forward! Below you will find descriptions of my past and current teaching and mentoring experiences.

> **Student Review Highlights:** <br>
> "Raphael was an amazing TA. He explained concepts from lecture really clearly, and was great at answering any questions that people had. He also made section engaging and interesting, and I definitely felt like section helped my performance in other parts of the course, which I don't always feel with all classes with section components." <br><br>
> "Raphael was a great teaching assistant! He was always very positive and enthusiastic in our discussion section. Furthermore, he did a great job of further explaining some of the more challenging
or confusing topics to help us understand and would answer any and all of our questions."
