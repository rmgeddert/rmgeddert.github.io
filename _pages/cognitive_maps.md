# <span style="color: MidnightBlue">Introduction to Cognitive Maps</span>

Classic work in rodents revealed the existence of so-called “cognitive maps”: internal models of the external world that allow for strategic planning and inference making. For example, Edward Tolman demonstrated in 1948 that mice will spontaneously use previously unseen shortcuts during maze exploration, suggesting that they had learned an abstract understanding of their space, rather than learning a sequence of reinforced *"left, right, left, left"* decisions as the conventional wisdom of behaviorism would have suggested.

It turns out that humans are just as capable in using cognitive maps for spatial navigation. In fact, modern research has conclusively demonstrated that cognitive maps are a fundamental organizational principle for all kinds of knowledge, helping scaffold and facilitate learning and memory in a variety of circumstances. For example, cognitive maps lie at the heart of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_language_acquisition" target="_blank">statistical language learning</a> in infants and in the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2021699118" target="_blank">learning of social hierarchies</a>, and have even been shown to help inference in more abstract spaces, such as a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5248972/" target="_blank">two-dimensional space defined by bird neck and leg lengths</a> (called "bird-space"). <span style="color: red">Critically, however, it remains unknown whether cognitive maps also support the organization and implementation of higher-order cognitive processes such as cognitive control or attention, the focus of this line of work.</span>
