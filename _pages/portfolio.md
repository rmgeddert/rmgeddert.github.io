    title: "Cognitive Maps"
    excerpt: "Humans organize hierarchical information about their world into so-called \"cognitive maps\". But, do cognitive maps also guide higher cognitive processes and strategies like attention or cognitive control? In this line of work, I explore the fundamental computational bases of these processes and how they are organized in the brain."

    alt: "Cognitive Stability and Flexibility"
    title: "Cognitive Stability and Flexibility"
    excerpt: "Adaptive behavior requires the ability to focus on a particular task or goal while avoiding distraction, known as cognitive stability, like reading a book in a busy coffee shop. It is also necessary to shift to new tasks in response to changing circumstances, known as cognitive flexibility, like answering an unexpected phone call. How these cognitive processes interact, and the computations underlying their regulation, remains an outstanding question in the field of cognitive psychology and neuroscience."
