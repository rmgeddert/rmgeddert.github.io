Hi! I am a 4th year PhD candidate (graduating ~ 05/24) studying computational and cognitive neuroscience at Duke University. I use a variety of data science and machine learning tools and analytic techniques to study the neural and computational bases of cognitive control and reinforcement learning. You can find my portfolio, resume, teaching and mentoring portfolio, and certificates above.
