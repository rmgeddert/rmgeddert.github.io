Hi! I am a rising 4th year PhD candidate (graduating ~ 05/24) studying cognitive and computational neuroscience at Duke University. I have a particular interest in AI, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and data science, along with a passion for science communication and mentoring. You can find links to my portfolio, resume, teaching and mentoring portfolio, certificates, and various tutorials that I have created above.

  <p style="color: DarkOrange; margin: 5px; margin-left: 10px">In the summer of 2021, I began a passion project of taking as many LinkedIn Learning courses as I could. I massively increased my technical expertise in programming and data science, and I gained amazing new skills which I used in a variety of personal projects, which can be viewed in my <a href="portfolio">portfolio</a>.
